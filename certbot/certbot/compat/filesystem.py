    # (respectively ntsecuritycon.FILE_GENERIC_READ and ntsecuritycon.FILE_GENERIC_EXECUTE).
    #
    # But ntsecuritycon.FILE_GENERIC_WRITE does not correspond to what one could expect from a
    # write access on Linux: for Windows, FILE_GENERIC_WRITE does not include delete, move or
    # rename. This is something that requires ntsecuritycon.FILE_ALL_ACCESS.
    # So to reproduce the write right as POSIX, we will apply ntsecuritycon.FILE_ALL_ACCESS
    # subtracted of the rights corresponding to POSIX read and POSIX execute.
    #
    # Finally, having read + write + execute gives a ntsecuritycon.FILE_ALL_ACCESS,
    # so a "Full Control" on the file.
